## Figma Fetch

This web based tool uses Figma REST API and a `DOCUMENT` ID input to request and process and extract some basic `COMPONENT`, `COMPONENT-SET`, and `DOCUMENT` data, including Node IDs.

The most important piece of information provided by the API is Node IDs for each `COMPONENT-SET` which can be used to develop tools for a design system.
